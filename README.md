# DollarFare

This is a TypseScript/React-Recux based web app for viewing realtime
foreign exchange pair values in tables and in networks.

### To Navigate:
Only a front end exists right now, so to navigate on the landing page (localhost:300) select the 'continue as guest option'
to enter the home page.

The more interesting code lives around src/App/LoggedInPage/LoggedInContainers/viewBuilders/ForexBuilder


## TODO:

-css spacing, style, allignment, padding...
    - things dont all line up on al monitors, and especially with page zoom, the divs go wonky
- UI for table filtering (sort order and selecting nodes)
- UI for interacting with FX model
    - buttons to add/remove things
- Fix up data model when passing to network component
