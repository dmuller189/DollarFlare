some TODOs:
1) workable interacte forexViewer
    - view and interact with graph
    - control graph (edges and nodes) editing
    - query edge weights
    - implement Bellman-Ford arbitrage algorithm
    - Pretty! 
2) second preliminary view with refactor
    - instead of ./createForex and ./createView2 ...
        have a /create/ director, so it would look like
        /create/forex/ and /create/View2 so it could re-use the naming component.
            - migh include hving to refactor redux store, so seems like 
            a fair bit of work with perhaps little benefit
3) nicer file configuration and cut down
4) Refactoring to reduce waste and re-use 
    - url encoding (see detail from point 2)


miscelanious small things and aesthetics
    - error handing for messing with the url
        - entering a new createForex ID in url bar causes infinite loop  
          Or than a obscure urls break it
    - css padding and hardcodedness (input forms)
    - and better styling and more attractive colors/features
    - hook up to heroku and deploy with dollarflare.com
    - order of sidebar view listings
    - placeholder of naming text when switching between views/projects
